## Overview

You get a library of OpenQASM circuits and the measured wall-clock time to simulate
each one on a fixed CPU simulator, at several settings. Build a program that reads a
raw circuit file and predicts how long the simulation will take, in seconds.

Some circuits are too complex to finish in the 4-hour cap and time out. Predicting
those matters too, since a timeout is itself a signal that a circuit is overly
complex for that setting. Your output is always a number of seconds: predict
≥ 14,400 s (the cap) for a run you expect to time out. How your model gets there,
e.g. a timeout classifier first or one continuous runtime target, is up to you.

You will build two things:

1. A **feature parser** — turns a `.qasm` file into a feature vector.
2. A **model** — maps `(features, simulator setting)` → predicted runtime.

Designing the feature set is the core of the challenge. No parser or feature list is provided.

## Timeline

| Milestone | When |
|---|---|
| Kickoff — training dataset released | 10am 9/26 |
| Hold-out circuits released | final hours of the event |
| Submissions close | 10am 9/27 |
| Results | 6pm 9/27 |

Competition is **team-based**. Team size and division of labor are up to you.

## The task

- **Input:** one OpenQASM circuit, plus the simulator `threshold` it will run at.
- **Output:** the predicted wall-clock runtime, in seconds, for that
  `(circuit, threshold)` pair.
- Threshold controls an internal simulator tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The same circuit at a higher
  threshold generally runs longer, so `threshold` is a model input, not a constant.
- Runs are capped at **4 hours**. Some circuits time out, predicting that is part
  of the task, since it signals a circuit is too complex to simulate at that
  setting. There is no separate timeout flag: predict ≥ 14,400 s for a run you
  expect to time out.

Filenames are **scrambled IDs**. The source algorithm is not a usable feature.
Circuit *structure* that happens to reveal the algorithm (e.g. a recognizable QFT block) is fair game.

## Runtime & timeouts

Each `(circuit, threshold)` pair in the training data has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `status` | `success` or `timeout` |
| `duration_s` | wall-clock seconds; blank when `status = timeout` |

A `timeout` means the run was killed at the 4-hour cap so the true duration is
unknown. These circuits are included deliberately:
recognizing that a circuit is heading for a timeout (i.e. is overly complex for the
given setting) is a meaningful part of the prediction problem. For scoring, a
timeout counts as exactly the cap (14,400 s), so any prediction ≥ 14,400 s gets
full credit on it.

## Dataset

**~532 circuits** from four sources, each run at up to **3 simulator thresholds**
(`16, 64, 512`) → **~1,500 labeled runs**.

| Source | Circuits | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| MQT Bench | 179 | Algorithmic benchmarks, each algorithm swept across sizes (2–260 qubits) |
| QASMBench | 80 | Application benchmarks (small / medium / large tiers) |
| Quantinuum | 83 | Challenge circuits across 5 families |
| Google Quantum Supremacy 2019 | 190 | Sycamore random circuits, full + elided variants, 12–53 qubits |

- **Circuits:** [`quantathon-harness/circuits/`](quantathon-harness/circuits/), one
  `<id>.qasm.zst` per circuit.
- **Format:** OpenQASM, one circuit per file, `zstd`-compressed as `.qasm.zst`
  (see [below](#getting-the-raw-qasm-files) to decompress). Some circuits are
  OpenQASM 2.0 while others are 3.0. Make sure your parser can handle both.
- **Labels:** [`quantathon-harness/runtime-data.csv`](quantathon-harness/runtime-data.csv), one row per run: `filename`, `threshold`, `duration_s` (blank on timeout),
  `status` (`success` / `timeout`), plus the fixed run settings (`shots`,
  `backend`, `precision`). There is one prediction target, the runtime in
  seconds; a `timeout` row counts as ≥14,400 s.
- **Qubit cap:** 260

### Getting the raw `.qasm` files

The circuits are compressed to keep the repo small: ~27 MB compressed vs. ~950 MB
of raw QASM (the largest single circuit is ~200 MB). The harness reads `.qasm.zst`
directly, so you only need raw files for your own exploration and training.

Decompress into a folder **outside** `quantathon-harness/circuits/`. The harness
reads every `.qasm` and `.qasm.zst` in that folder, so raw copies there would be
predicted twice.

Install `zstd` (`brew install zstd`, `apt install zstd`, or
[releases](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases) on Windows), then:

```bash
mkdir -p raw-circuits
zstd -d --output-dir-flat raw-circuits quantathon-harness/circuits/*.qasm.zst
```

To read them from Python instead, reuse `read_qasm()` in
[`quantathon-harness/run.py`](quantathon-harness/run.py). Plain
`zstandard.decompress()` fails on these files.

## What you build

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Feature parser** | `.qasm` → features. You design the features. Must run in **≤ 15 s per circuit**, large circuits included. |
| **Model** | Predicts runtime, in seconds, from `(features, threshold)`; predict ≥ 14,400 s for a run you expect to time out. Final inference should take **≤ 15 s per circuit**. |

Both plug into the submission harness: implement `featurize` and `predict` in
[`quantathon-harness/model.py`](quantathon-harness/model.py). See the
[harness README](quantathon-harness/README.md).

You must be able to **explain every part of your submission**.

## Judging & scoring

Your final score is **1/3 automated + 2/3 subjective**.

### Automated — did you get the right results? (1/3)

**Duration accuracy** on a **hidden hold-out set** of circuits, separate from the
training library. For each `(circuit, threshold)`, predicted vs. measured runtime is
scored on a **log scale**:

```
score = max(0, 1 − |log10(pred / actual)| / 2)
```

An exact prediction scores 100%; off by 10× scores 0%. Log scale because runtimes
span seconds to hours — being 2× off costs the same whether the run is 1 second or
1 hour. Your automated score is the average over **every** hold-out run; a run
missing from your submission scores 0.

**Timeouts** are folded into the same metric: a timed-out circuit is scored against
the 4-hour cap, so you "predict a timeout" simply by predicting a duration ≥ the cap
(that earns full credit), and predicting seconds under the cap for timed out circuits is penalized like any other miss. **There is no separate timeout flag**.

**Speed** is measured too: your parser and inference must stay under the per-circuit
cutoff (see *What you build*). Runs over the cutoff may be penalized.

### Subjective — how you got there (2/3)

Judged live from your presentation and write-up, each category scored 1–5. The five
are **weighted equally** — each is worth ≈ 13.3% of your final score (together the
2/3 subjective portion).

| Category | What we look for |
|---|---|
| **Novelty of approach** | Original, well-justified feature engineering / modeling — not blind tool use. |
| **Above & beyond** | Meaningful work past the core: extra analysis, validation, depth, polish. |
| **Thought process & learning** | Clear problem understanding, hypotheses, iteration, and learning over the project. |
| **Quality of presentation** | Clear explanation of problem/approach/results; honest error analysis; direct answers. |
| **Handling challenges** | Smart tradeoffs and resilience against messy data, time, and resource limits. |

You must be able to **explain every part of your submission** — this is scored.

Hold-out circuits are released in the **final hours** so you run your model on them
and submit your predictions before final judging.

## Submission

When the hold-out circuits are DM'd to you, put them in
`quantathon-harness/circuits/` and run the harness:

```bash
cd quantathon-harness
python run.py --team "Your Team Name"
```

It writes **`submission.csv`**. **DM `submission.csv` back to us** — that's your
entry for the automated score. Your presentation and write-up are judged live for
the subjective score.

## Rules

- **Teams.** Team-based; size and work split up to you.
- **Build your own parser.** No starter parser or feature list is provided.
- **No filename shortcuts.** IDs are scrambled — do not try to recover the source
  or algorithm from file metadata.
- **Own your solution.** You must understand and be able to explain everything you
  submit.
- **Language / libraries / external data.** _(TBA)_

## Simulator environment

The runtimes you are given come from:

- A fixed **single-node CPU backend**.
- **Single precision.**
- `threshold` ∈ `{16, 64, 512}`.
- **4-hour** timeout per run.

Fidelity is not modeled, this is purely runtime prediction for fixed simulator settings.

### Reference hardware

All runtimes were measured on one machine:

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | Intel Core Ultra 9 285K |
| Cores | 24 physical / 24 logical |
| RAM | 128 GB @ 6400 MHz |
